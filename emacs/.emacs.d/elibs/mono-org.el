;;; Commentary:
;;  I use org-mode mainly to take notes (see mono-notes) to manage tasks and
;;  appointments (org-agenda), to manage spaced repetition flashcards
;;  (org-drill) and even for doing some literate programming.

;;; Code:

(require 'mono-base-package)

;; this package implements a “modern” style for your Org buffers using

;; keywords, tables and source blocks. The styling is configurable,
;; you can enable, disable or modify the style of each syntax element
;; individually via the org-modern customization group.

;; org-modern provides a clean and efficient org style. The blocks
;; (e.g. source, example) are particularly nice. But when org-indent
;; is enabled, the block "bracket", which uses the fringe area, is
;; disabled.  This small package reproduces the block styling of
;; org-modern when using org-indent:
;; (use-package org-modern-indent
;;   :straight (:host github :repo "jdtsmith/org-modern-indent" :branch "main")
;;   :hook (org-indent-mode . org-modern-indent-mode))

;; this package is needed to perform syntax highlight in
;; code fragments exported from org-files into html files
(use-package htmlize)

;; this package allows running gnuplot files from within the GNU Emacs
;; editor (you will also need the gnuplot system package)
(use-package gnuplot)
