# ⚙️ unmonoqueteclea's dotfiles

These are the dotfiles that powers my daily work.  I use `Ubuntu
22.04` (although sometimes I test them on `macOS`.

My `GNU Emacs` configuration is also included in the repository.

## quickstart

`GNU Stow` is required to be create links to repo files from your home
directory. To create automatically all those links, run 

```sh
make stow

```


## synced data folder
Some of these configurations assumed a synced data folder. I use
`Google Drive`, with `rclone` helping me to synchronize the files.
